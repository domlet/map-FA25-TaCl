## What did I build?

["My first map" website]()  is a one-page,  that offers a interactive map for three areas i went to in the Bay Area. 

Users can...
1. **Toggle through my map**, by tapping red dots in front of the screen.
2. **Explore each map** by using gestures to zoom in/out anywhere, rotate the map orientation, or change the pitch (angle).
3. **Enjoy** Have fun looking at the map!

Here's a demo:

## Why did I build this?

I wanted to document a map to show places i visited during the summer. I believe it's very nice to let others acess this interactive map. The first one is the movie theaters, i know everyone knows the movie theater is a really nice place to hangout at.
